# Tic Tac Toe Game (React.js)

This is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using React.js, demonstrating my skills in front-end development and creating interactive user interfaces. The game offers an intuitive user experience with a responsive 3x3 grid layout and an **AI opponent** for single-player mode.

# Key Features:
- Implemented game logic to enable players to take turns placing X and O symbols on the board, with **real-time updates** to the game state.
- Developed an AI opponent using the **minimax algorithm**, providing an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.
- Designed a visually appealing user interface with modern and colorful styling, utilizing CSS animations and hover effects.

# Technologies Used:
- React.js: Leveraged the power of React's component-based architecture to create a dynamic and efficient user interface.
- JavaScript: Utilized JavaScript for implementing game logic, win detection algorithms, and the minimax algorithm for the AI opponent.
- CSS: Styled the game board and buttons using CSS, incorporating animations and hover effects to enhance user interaction.

# Additional Details:
- Implemented win detection algorithms to determine the outcome of the game, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal pattern checks.
- Incorporated a draw detection mechanism to identify when all cells are filled without a winner.
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by implementing the minimax algorithm for the AI opponent, enabling it to make optimal moves.
